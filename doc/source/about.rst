=====About=====Welcome to the Data Exchange file format web site, DXfile for short.The DXfile web site provides:    - The definition of the scientific data exchange   - A python interface for writing scientific data exchange files   - XML attribute files for writing scientific data exchange file with the EPICS Area Detector HDF plug inData Exchange is a set of guidelines for storing scientific data andmetadata in a Hierarchical Data Format 5 :cite:`HDF:01` file. The design guidelines for Data Exchange provide a starting point to which one may add customdata and metadata to solve particular problems.HDF5 :cite:`HDF:01` has many important characteristics for scientific data storage. Itoffers platform-independent binary data storage with optionalcompression, hierarchical data ordering, and support for MPI-basedparallel computing. Data are stored with alphanumeric tags, so that onecan examine a HDF5 file’s contents with no knowledge of how the filewriting program was coded. Tools for this examination include theHDF5-supplied command-line utility :cite:`HDF:02` to examine the contents 
of any HDF5 file, or the freely-available Java program :cite:`HDF:03`to interactively examine the file.

At synchrotron facilities using the EPICS :cite:`EPICS:01` software for area detectors :cite:`AD:01` with the
NDFileHDF5 plugin :cite:`AD:02`, is possible to save Data Exchange files by properly configure
the detector and the HDF schema attribute files .  
 This reference guide describes the basic design principles of DataExchange, examples of their application, a core reference for guidelinescommon to most uses, and coding examples.
